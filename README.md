# EmotionDetection
This repository is the implementation of paper "Geometric positions and Optical Flow based Emotion Detection using MLP and Reduced Dimensions" by Gulraiz khan. 
It captures the geometric positions based emotion using facial features based on FACS standard using MLP.  

## Getting Started

For setting up this project you have to follow the following steps. 
* Create project userinterface in visual studio by choosing c# as primary language. 
* Create simple projects for all folders except userinterface and libs. (ASSVS.EDR, ASSVS.FAS.EDR, ...).
* Run Interface project for testing. 

### Prerequisites

You will need basic understanding of image processing and programming to run this system. 
* Download the EmguCV and openCV. 
* Setup EmguCV in your project and place dlls in your userinterface project. (MSVCP140D.DLL, VCRUNTIME140D.DLL, concrt140d.dll).
* Run the system.

## Running the tests

For running the test you only need to run userinterface project and provide either image from your system or check emotion though your webcam. 

## Built With

* [EmguCV](http://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) - Image processing framework
* [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) - Machine learning framework
